{"payload":"tests: pass (22/22), lint: pass (0 errors), typecheck: pass (all 4 workspaces). Added 6 new Prometheus metrics (pipeline_stage_events_total, pipeline_questions_processed_total, pipeline_gemini_api_calls_total, pipeline_runs_completed_total, pipeline_questions_per_category_total, pipeline_similarity_groups_total) with helper functions. Instrumented all 5 worker stages with info/warn/error logging that feeds Prometheus counters. Fixed pipelines_started_total counter in API.
