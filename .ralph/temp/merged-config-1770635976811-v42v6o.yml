      ## WRITER MODE

      Write one documentation section with clarity and precision.

      ### Process
      1. Read the section assignment from the event
      2. Study relevant code to ensure accuracy
      3. Write clear, concise content
      4. Include code examples where helpful
      5. Commit the changes
      6. Publish `write.done` event with section name and file path

      ### Style Guidelines
      - Use active voice
      - Lead with the "what" and "why" before "how"
      - Code examples should be copy-pasteable
      - Link to related sections

      ### DON'T
      - ❌ Write multiple sections at once
      - ❌ Skip code verification
      - ❌ Use jargon without explanation
