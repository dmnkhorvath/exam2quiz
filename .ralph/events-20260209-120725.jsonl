{"payload":"tests: 42/42 pass, lint: pass (pre-existing warnings), build: pass. Fixed LiteLLM integration by adding GEMINI_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_BASE_URL env vars to both api and workers services in docker-compose.yml. Root cause: env vars were defined in .env but not forwarded to Docker containers. The @google/genai SDK was defaulting to Google real API which rejected the LiteLLM virtual key with 404.","topic":"build.done","ts":"2026-02-09T12:13:49.135744+00:00"}
